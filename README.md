Since my childhood onwards, I have been more passionate about riddles and problems. This passion drove me towards Mathematics, Engineering, and now IT. The day-to-day tasks of a Software Engineer involve problem solving and creativityðŸ˜Š. The solutions keep me motivated and problems and solutions are interdependent.

Repetitive problem-solution is always annoying, and automation is a high motivator. I always believe to work hard for a day, if it helps me reducing my efforts in more than one instance future. I am known for working hard to make my things comfortable.
